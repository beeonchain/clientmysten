This section explains some of the common concepts when working with GraphQL, such as altering behavior using [HTTP headers](./graphql-rpc/headers), re-using query snippets with [variables](./graphql-rpc/variables) and [fragments](./graphql-rpc/fragments), consuming [paginated queries](./graphql-rpc/pagination), and understanding and working within the [limits](./graphql-rpc/limits) enforced by the service.

For more details on GraphQL fundamentals, see the introductory documentation from [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql).

If you are interested in how to interact with the Sui network via the GraphQL RPC, see the [getting started](guides/developer/getting-started/graphql-rpc.mdx) guide. If you are looking for information on migrating from JSON-RPC to GraphQL, see the [migration](../guides/developer/advanced/graphql-migration.mdx) guide.
